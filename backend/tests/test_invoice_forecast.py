"""Money promised, in the forecast, without being counted twice.

The whole reason invoices stayed out of the projected balance until now:
the same R$5.000 is routinely an open invoice *and* a pending bank credit,
and nothing could say they were the same money. Payment matching is what
says it, so these tests care less about "does an invoice show up" than
about "does it stop showing up the moment the payment does".
