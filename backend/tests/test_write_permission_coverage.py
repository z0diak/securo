"""Every mutating route declares an explicit permission decision.

This is the test the codebase was missing, and the reason it was missing is
the reason it is worth having: the write gate is a **dependency wrapper**,
so `require_write` appears in one file and grepping the routes for it
returns nothing. An audit did exactly that and reported that none of the
111 write routes were gated, when 85 of them were. The claim propagated
into three documents before someone re-read the code by hand.

So this walks the dependency graph the way the framework does, and answers
the question mechanically instead of leaving it to memory.

**It asserts the property, not the mechanism.** The rule is "a mutating
route reaches some recognised permission decision", with the recognised set
in `WRITE_GATES` below. Permissions may later become per-action, per-module
or per-view; when a narrower guard exists, it is added to that set and this
test keeps holding. Phrasing it as "must depend on
`current_writable_workspace`" would make the test an obstacle to the very
change it should survive.
