"""Match recurring bills to the real transactions that pay them (issue #116).

A recurring bill (rent, a subscription) is charged to a bank account or credit
card, and bank sync then imports that charge as its own transaction. Without
linking, the user ends up with two rows: the bill's generated placeholder and
the synced charge. This service reconciles the two.

Matching signals (the intersection of what Actual and Sure use): same account,
same direction (``type``), exact amount, transaction date within a small window
of the expected occurrence, and description token-similarity above the same bar
the bank-sync fuzzy merge already uses. Matches are one-to-one and only the
high-confidence (exact-amount) tier auto-links; softer/variable-amount matching
is intentionally left for a later suggestion-based pass.
